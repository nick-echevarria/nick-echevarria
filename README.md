A versatile software engineer who enjoys working on challenging, meaningful problems. Interested in the intersection of tech and design with a focus on sustainability, gaming, media, fashion, and fitness.

Experienced in Javascript/Typescript-based programming (React/Redux/Node/Express) and working with SQL/NoSQL databasing. Passionate about front-end development, clean code, empathetic communication and collaboration, and leading with curiosity. 

When I'm not programming, I have a wide array of hobbies including practicing Spanish and Italian around NYC, pushing my running pace,  fixed-gear biking city streets, keeping up with film, TV & literature, playing lots of Street Fighter and Magic: The Gathering with friends, and practicing jiu-jitsu!
