👋🏾 Hey there!👋🏾

My name is Nicholas Echevarria, but you can call me Nick. I'm a software engineer and writer. 

I'm a Brooklyn native whose curiosity has led me around the world, a curiosity that was fueled and shaped by the advent of and access to the internet and video gaming at a young age. As a result, I’m lucky to have experienced a wide variety of adventures both physical and digital, from teaching English in places like Spain and China to working hospitality at some of the most popular venues in New York City, all the while nurturing a copywriting and content writing career over eight years. 

Statitsically speaking, these kinds of inspiring, formative experiences are typically not in reach for someone with my background. This is why I'm a software engineer: to challenge myself, better my surroundings, and better those I care for through the power of code. 

- 🔨 I'm currently working on [Triple Triad](https://youtu.be/QHVHftxr2os), a card game based on the Playstation classic _Final Fantasy 8_
- 🌱 I’m currently reinforcing my knowledge of Vanilla Javascript
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I believe play, whether that's during elementary school recess, wrestling, over a board game, or on the latest 4K television, can change the world
- 📖 I write blog articles exploring the world of code over at [Medium](https://medium.com/@nickechevarria)
