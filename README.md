👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾 Hey there! 

My name is Nicholas Echevarria and I'm a Brooklyn native whose curiosity has led me around the world, a curiosity that was fueled and shaped by the advent of and access to the internet at a young age. 

As a result, I’m lucky to have experienced a wide variety of adventures, from teaching English in places like Spain and China to working hospitality at some of the most popular venues in New York City, all the while nurturing a copywriting and content writing career over eight years. 

All of these fundamental experiences are typically not in reach for someone like me. This is why I'm a software engineer: to challenge myself, better my surroundings, and better those I care for through the power of code. 

- 🔭 I'm currently working on Triple Triad, a card game based on the Playstation classic _Final Fantasy 8_
- 🌱 I’m currently reinforcing my learning on Vanilla Javascript
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've chatted with some high profile people, including Michael Keaton and Bill Clinton
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasechevarria/) || [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_nickechevarria) || [Gmail](nick.echev@gmail.com)
